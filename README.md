# Racecar

You're in charge of simulating a race, but your boss is telling you the race is returning incorrect results. Fix issues with the program until you get the actual results which should be:

- Red Car in 1st with 2272.5 feet travelled
- Blue Car in 4th with 1890 feet travelled
- Green Car in 2nd with 2191.5 feet travelled
- Yellow Car in 3rd with 2163 feet travelled
